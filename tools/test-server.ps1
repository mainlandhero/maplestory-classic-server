.SYNOPSIS
    Run the client against the real login server, with characters that persist.

.DESCRIPTION
    The replacement for test-charselect.ps1. That script drives tools/handshake_probe.py,
    which replays bodies handed to it on a command line; this one starts crates/login,
    which reads and writes a database. The visible difference is the one that matters:
    a character created in one run is still there in the next.

    Everything else is deliberately identical to the run that is known to work - the same
    client patches, the same launch mode, the same exit forensics - so that if a run goes
    wrong, the server is the only thing that changed.

    THE CLIENT PATCHES ARE STILL PATCHES. Nothing here makes the session valid:

      1415db360:ret     skip the server-reachability check. NOT OPTIONAL: without it the
                        client __fastfails after ~37 seconds, because that check overruns
                        its own stack buffer when every address is unreachable. A client
                        bug, on a path that only ever runs because we are firewalled.
      141b2a280:rdx=0   suppress the "trouble logging in" dialog, which otherwise blocks
                        the per-frame tick that enables the Login button.
      mode=2            leave the client's mode-5 auto-login so the button gets a turn.
      create=on         set the protected flag that gates "Create a character". The real
                        service sets this from virtualised code and we have not found the
                        packet that does it.

    The last two are standing in for protocol we have not implemented. See
    docs/launcher.md for which patches retire and when.

# -SetFieldProbe swaps two of the four watch slots. The other two are not negotiable:
# 1415db360:ret and 141b2a280:rdx=0 keep the client alive and unblocked, and dropping
# either kills it at ~37s. What goes is 141b36f60, the migration handler - the channel's
# own log already proves the migration, because the client connects and sends 0x007D - and
# 142ef3e44, __report_gsfailure, whose failure mode is still visible in client-exit.log as
# an exit at ~37s, just less precisely.
#
# The two free slots moved on 2026-08-19. 142097f80 and 142cfb500 have both already done
# their job - the run of that day caught SetField entering its handler while dispatching
# 0x01A0, with the latch measured at 0x00 - so re-arming them would re-answer a settled
# question. The open question is now one step further in:
#
#   140304b20  the character-record decoder. Fires if SetField reached the record branch.
#   140302e30  the character-STAT decoder, the block presence[0] is supposed to switch on.
#
# Those two discriminate cleanly, which is the point:
#   neither fires        -> SetField never reached the record path
#   only 140304b20       -> the record decoded but the gate SKIPPED the stat block, i.e.
#                           presence[0] is the wrong byte
#   both                 -> the gate fired and the stats decoded; anything still wrong is
#                           downstream of the map id, not the presence array
#
# 140302e30 also has a built-in positive control. It has exactly two callers in the whole
# image (python tools/callers.py 0x140302e30): this record path, and the character-LIST
# path. So it should fire once at character select, on the login connection, well before
# the migration. If it fires there and NOT after SetField, the probe is demonstrably armed
# and working and the gate genuinely did not open - a silent negative that means something,
# which is the thing this project keeps having to prove the hard way.
#
# 140304b20 retired 2026-08-19: it fired, the gate opened, a character stands on map 1.
# Its slot now carries 142cfb500:peek=2358 - a FREE measurement on the portal run.
# 142cfb500 is called once per SetField from inside 142097f80, with RCX = the world object,
# so peeking +0x2358 reads the CUserLocal slot. That slot is the precondition for the SHORT
# characterData=0 SetField, the form actually designed for "same character, new map":
# research/transfer-field-request.md proved the precondition's identity but could NOT prove
# the slot is ever populated (222 readers, no store found). The peek settles it, and carries
# its own control - the first SetField should read 0, and the second says whether the short
# form is safe to use next time.
#
# Retired 2026-08-19 (round two), both answered on the run that made NPCs appear:
#   141e75800  FIRED on 0x044F from inside CField::OnPacket - the NPC routing was right all
#              along, and the body's `enabled` and `alpha` zeros were what made them invisible.
#   1420dd920  NEVER fired - 0x0138's apply loop does not run, so it is a dead end for
#              dressing the local character.
#
# **For the channel-swap run the probe is NOT the instrument - world.log is.** The swap
# request's opcode is unknown, so there is no handler to watch; the client will name its own
# request in the log the way it named 0x00D1 and 0x0151. These two slots are free
# confirmations rather than a measurement, and neither can affect the client:
#   142cfb500:peek=2358  the world object's CUserLocal slot, once per SetField - including
#                        any SetField a channel swap produces.
#   140302e30:hits=200   the character-stat decoder; it fires at character select and again
#                        per world entry, so it confirms the record path on whichever
#                        channel the client ends up on.
#
# Retired earlier, and kept for the record:
#   142cfb500:peek=2358 -> [world+0x2358] read 0x00 on the FIRST SetField and NON-ZERO on
#     every later one. So the CUserLocal slot IS populated once a field has loaded, and the
#     short characterData=0 SetField's precondition holds for map CHANGES. Measured, not
#     inferred - research/transfer-field-request.md could not settle it statically.
#   142797be0 -> it FIRED. The local character is in the pool 0x0138 searches, and the
#     handler reached its apply. Yet the character is still naked, so the failure is INSIDE
#     the apply, which walks a list at user+0x1200 and only touches the look inside the loop.
#
# The two slots now answer the two things still broken:
#   141e75800  the NPC pool's dispatcher. Two callers only - FUN_141820080 (CField::OnPacket)
#              and the channel dispatcher. If it fires while dispatching 0x044F the routing
#              and timing are right and the BODY is wrong; if it stays silent the packet is
#              never dispatched at all and the trigger or the stage is wrong.
#   1420dd920  exactly ONE call site in the image, inside FUN_142797be0's loop. It fires only
#              if that loop body runs, so it separates "the look was applied and did not
#              render" from "the loop was empty and the look was never applied".
#
# (was) 142797be0 is THE question this run answers, and it is a clean binary. It has exactly ONE
# call site in the whole image (python tools/callers.py 0x142797be0): inside FUN_142d012e0,
# the 0x0138 UserAvatarModified handler, and *past* its `if (pool_lookup != 0)` gate. So:
#   it fires   -> the local character IS in that pool and the compact avatar look was applied
#   it is silent -> the local user is not in that pool, and 0x0138 is a dead end for dressing
#                   the local character; the fallback is the ELog route (see STATUS.md)
# Either way the client is unharmed: on a miss the handler returns having done nothing.
#
# 140302e30 retired - the record path is proven on screen.
#
# (was) :hits=200 on 140302e30 because it fires at character select as well - once per
# character in the list - and the default cap is 32 per slot. The probe does announce
# saturation ("watch hit limit reached"), so this would not have been silent, but the
# decisive line is the one AFTER the migration and losing it costs a whole launch.
#
# An explicit -Probe still wins, so a run can be aimed somewhere else without editing this.
# Two free slots, and two different questions competing for them - so the flag that decides
# which run this is also decides the instrument. Getting the wrong pair costs a whole launch,
# and the two questions cannot be answered in one run anyway: mobs are off unless -Mobs.
# **The instrument follows the VARIABLE, not the feature list.**
#
# This used to key off the mob flag, and on 2026-08-19 that quietly wasted a run: mobs became
# the default, so the mob watches were armed, so the bag watch was NOT - and the run came
# back with "0 hits on 140305e48", which reads exactly like "the client never read the
# inventory size" when it actually means "nobody was watching". An unarmed instrument that
# reports a clean zero is the single most expensive failure mode on this project.
#
# So: passing -InventorySlots means the bag is the variable, and the bag gets the watches.
