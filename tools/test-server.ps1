.SYNOPSIS
    Run the client against the real login server, with characters that persist.

.DESCRIPTION
    The replacement for test-charselect.ps1. That script drives tools/handshake_probe.py,
    which replays bodies handed to it on a command line; this one starts crates/login,
    which reads and writes a database. The visible difference is the one that matters:
    a character created in one run is still there in the next.

    Everything else is deliberately identical to the run that is known to work - the same
    client patches, the same launch mode, the same exit forensics - so that if a run goes
    wrong, the server is the only thing that changed.

    THE CLIENT PATCHES ARE STILL PATCHES. Nothing here makes the session valid:

      1415db360:ret     skip the server-reachability check. NOT OPTIONAL: without it the
                        client __fastfails after ~37 seconds, because that check overruns
                        its own stack buffer when every address is unreachable. A client
                        bug, on a path that only ever runs because we are firewalled.
      141b2a280:rdx=0   suppress the "trouble logging in" dialog, which otherwise blocks
                        the per-frame tick that enables the Login button.
      mode=2            leave the client's mode-5 auto-login so the button gets a turn.
      create=on         set the protected flag that gates "Create a character". The real
                        service sets this from virtualised code and we have not found the
                        packet that does it.

    The last two are standing in for protocol we have not implemented. See
    docs/launcher.md for which patches retire and when.

    #   1415db360:ret     skip the reachability check - without it the client __fastfails
    #   141b2a280:rdx=0   suppress the login dialog that blocks the Login button's tick
    #   142ef3e44:hits=8  the /GS site, so a second stack overflow would still be visible
    #   141b36a10:peek=1c0  the create-result handler, reading stage+0x1c0
    #
    # The last slot is the open question. FUN_141b36a10 handles 0x0015 and compares the
    # world id we send against stage+0x1c0; if they differ it returns having registered
    # nothing and shown nothing, which is indistinguishable from the packet never arriving.
    # On 2026-08-18 the client dispatched a successful 0x0015 and stayed on the creation
    # screen, so this reads the value it compared against. It replaces the watch on
    # 142e9ebd0 (the virtualised routine), which should never be entered now that the
    # reachability check is skipped, and was not entered on the last run.
    # 1415db360:ret and 141b2a280:rdx=0 are mandatory - without them the client dies at
    # ~37s and the "trouble connecting" dialog blocks the screen. The third slot watches
    # FUN_141b36f60, the migration handler: it is the difference between "the client
    # ignored our 0x0011" and "it never got there", and that handler bails silently on
    # several paths. Swap it back to 141b36a10:peek=1c0 when the create reply is the
    # subject again.
